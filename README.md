# Succulent Watering Device
A tool that helps succulent moms water their babies properly by detecting soil moisture and using a time-based reminder sound system.

##Team
Jamie Catacutan & Grace Dai

## Summary
Goal: To help novice succulent moms properly water their babies. Succulents can be difficult to keep alive especially for new owners who do not have a lot of knowledge or experience for succulent care, as their watering needs are very different from normal plants. The tool will be stuck into the soil, and will use moisture sensors to detect moisture levels, which would be indicated by LED lights on the tool. The tool will also allow the user to set a repeating reminder when to water the plants (e.g. once a week), and the tool will play sounds when the time comes to water the plants.

## Component Parts
Moisture sensor
LED lights
Small speaker
Wires
Battery
Breadboard?
Body/base to connect and house everything (maybe a container or a 3D printed body)

## Challenges
Programming the components to work together (e.g. moisture sensor detects moisture levels and relays information to arduino, which makes LEDs light up)

## Timeline
What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible!

* Week 1: Write proposal
* Week 2: Moisture sensors
* Week 3: LED lights
* Week 4: Sound system, and if there is time, house everything together
* Week 5: Present!
